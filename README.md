# Dataathon
Data Analysis, Visualization, and Inference of a business dataset for a hackathon. 
The report, pre-processing, and modeling of the ML model are uploaded here.

Preprocessing:
1) missing values treatment
2) label encoding
3) imbalanced class handling

Supervised Models Built:
1) logistic regression
2) random forest
3) gradient/ada-boosting

Choice of Evaluation Metric:
1) ROC-AUC curves

Overfitting avoidance mechanism:
1) Elastic Net Regularization: Elastic Net adds penalty terms to the loss function discouraging the model from assigning too much importance to any one feature, making it less prone to overfitting.

Model Hyperparameter Tuning:
Grid Search systematically explores a predefined set of hyperparameter combinations conduct a comprehensive search to find the best set of hyperparameters.
